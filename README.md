### Adding Your Own Media

Edit the `mediaItems` array in `app/page.tsx` to add your own images and videos:

```typescript
const mediaItems = [
  {
    id: 1,
    type: "image", // or "video"
    title: "Your Title",
    desc: "Your description",
    url: "your-image-or-video-url",
    span: "col-span-1 row-span-2 md:col-span-1 md:row-span-3 sm:col-span-1 sm:row-span-2",
  },
  // Add more items...
]
```

### Styling

The component uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can customize the appearance by:

1. Modifying the CSS variables in `app/globals.css`
2. Adjusting the Tailwind classes in `components/interactive-bento-gallery.tsx`
3. Updating the `tailwind.config.js` file for custom breakpoints and themes
